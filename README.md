Welcome to my Next.js project, designed to showcase the integration of TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling purposes. This project serves as a learning platform for mastering Next.js development practices.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to enhance my proficiency in Next.js by building a functional web application. Through this endeavor, I aim to solidify my understanding of modern web development techniques and best practices.

Technologies Used
Next.js: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language, enhancing code quality and understandability.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
Prisma: An open-source database toolkit that simplifies database workflows in application development. It is utilized in this project to manage database operations efficiently within the Next.js environment.
By incorporating these technologies, I aspire to create a robust, scalable, and aesthetically pleasing web application that demonstrates my growing expertise in full-stack development.
